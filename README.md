DreamTeam - ApiMart


This is our project submission where we were tasked to create a site that utilizes multiple API's, frameworks, and is overall user-friendly. This project uses four API's (weather, location, COVID-19, and news API), the Bootstrap Framework, the jQuery Framework, the Google Cloud Platform, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more to deliver an all in one location to access general, but necessary, information. 

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://anshul123kumar.github.io/DreamTeam-ApiMart/

Thanks!
