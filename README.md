# *** Api-Mart ***


This is my project submission where i was challanged to create a site that utilizes multiple API's, frameworks, and is overall user-friendly. This project uses four API's (weather, location, COVID-19, and news API), the Bootstrap Framework, the jQuery library, the Google Cloud Platform, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to access general, but necessary information. 

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://anshul123kumar.github.io/ApiMart/

Thanks!
